# Visualisation of binary search
The PyQt5 library was used to visualize the binary search in the Python programming language. 
This library has elements called Widgets that represent different elements of the GUI. 
For the purposes of this project, a class was created that is inherited from the QMainWindow class that belongs to the PyQt5 library.
